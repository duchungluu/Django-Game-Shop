Dreamer Team Project Plan
-----------------------

### 1. Team

525698 Teemu Huovinen
544566 Iiro Nurmi
544430 Mehrad Mohammadi


### 2. Goal

Our goal is the highest grade. We start by working with the mandatory features, and add as many optional features as we can.

### 3. Plans
Phase 1 planning and design:
Start by designing the platform, that includes the database schema and possible architecture/domain modeling.
Few mockups or if not too time consuming, we will build the "mockups" with HTML/CSS. The plan is to have a good picture on how the platform should look like.

Phase 2 Basic features:
Start to implement features based on the models. Basic player and developer features (CRUD create, read, update, delete).
Basic UI for those features.
From basic CRUD features on, implement more advanced.
This phase includes user registration and possibly authentication.

Phase 3 continuing to more features:
Features include:
** Authentication
** Payment functionality
** Game/service interaction

Phase 4 optional features (if time):
Optional features in prioritized order:

* 3rd party login
* RESTful API (which we will keep in mind from the start)
* Mobile friendly (which we will keep in mind from the start)
* Save-load and resolution feature
* Social media sharing

Phase 5 testing and polishing:
The phase 5 includes a lot of testing and then on fixing and enhancing the platform.



### 4. Process and Time Schedule

#### 4.1. Deadlines

* 13.12.2015   Group registration
* 20.12.2015   Project Plan
* 20.02.2016   Final submission


#### 4.2. Communication

Telegram is used for chat-type communication. Trello will be used for tracking of the progress of features.
We will try to arrange at least one face to face meeting per week.

** Game/service interaction
* 07.02 - 20.02: Optional functionalities and testing

### 5. Testing

We will practice TDD-style of feature design on a smaller feature, but not the whole project.
We will do unit-testing, where unit-tests are developed as part of feature development.
Acceptance testing will be performed in Heroku.

### 6. Risk Analysis

* Unforeseen, longer absences (sicknesses etc).
** Only three group members so losing even one group member for a week is detrimental.

* Falling behind in schedule
** Other courses, design refactoring

* Not dividing the project to tasks well enough
** Lacking expertise produces development and design overhead

* Design failures
** Not taking all features into consideration during design

* Teemu getting a job
** Minor risk with a big impact to group member availability
