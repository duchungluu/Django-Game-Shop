### 1. Team

525698 Teemu Huovinen
544566 Iiro Nurmi

### 2. Goal

Our goal is the highest grade. We start by working with the mandatory features, and add as many optional features as we can.

### 3. Plans

Optional features in prioritized order:

* 3rd party login
* RESTful API (which we will keep in mind from the start)
* Mobile friendly (which we will keep in mind from the start)
* Save-load and resolution feature
* Social media sharing

** Game/service interaction
* 07.02 - 20.02: Optional functionalities and testing

### 5. Testing

We will practice TDD-style of feature design on a smaller feature, but not the whole project.
We will do unit-testing, where unit-tests are developed as part of feature development.
Acceptance testing will be performed in Heroku.

### 6. Risk Analysis

* Unforeseen, longer absences (sicknesses etc).
** Only three group members so losing even one group member for a week is detrimental.

* Falling behind in schedule
** Other courses, design refactoring

* Not dividing the project to tasks well enough
** Lacking expertise produces development and design overhead

* Design failures
** Not taking all features into consideration during design

* Teemu getting a job
** Minor risk with a big impact to group member availability
